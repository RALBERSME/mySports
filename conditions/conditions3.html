      <p>
        Maybe you didn't know it, but in ancient Egypt there were many temples
        along the Nile. They were dedicated to different deities and were among
        other things used for tests of courage. You can go into one of these
        temples right now; it is a special invitation that only selected people
        receive. Your task is to dive into the depths and find the way out of
        the labyrinth. The water is very murky, means you can only see a few
        centimetres directly in front of you. It is therefore important to make
        quick decisions, because your lungs need oxygen again after 2 minutes.
        If you don't manage to surface within 2 minutes, you die. But if you
        find the exit from the labyrinth within 2 minutes, you will be
        celebrated.<br /><small
