        Very important for the body and energy production are:
        <strong>MUSCLES</strong>,<strong>MYOKINES</strong>and
        <strong>MYOCHONDRIA.</strong> <br />Muscles are the largest metabolic
        organ. Muscles and the brain utilize the sugar we consume. When muscles
        are active, they release myokines. These are enzyme-like messengers that
        stimulate the body to grow and the like, especially the metabolic
        process. The mitochondria are the little "furnaces" in us. The
        mitochondria form a network that extends throughout the entire cell.
        They provide the energy that the cells need. It is therefore important
        that we have enough muscle mass. Watch details:
