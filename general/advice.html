          <u>To be clear: </u><br /><br />1.) If you are sick or in pain, you
          must see a doctor. Also, do not exercise if you are drunk, stoned,
          exhausted or unable to concentrate. As soon as you feel pain, stop the
          activity. Do not overstress your body.<br /><br />
          2.) <u><em>You are responsible for yourself </em></u>and your body. I
          am <u>not</u> liable for anything that happens to you.It is your risk.
          If you are not prepared to take responsibility for yourself, leave the
          <em> mySports</em>
          website, because then you are already lacking the basic requirements.
