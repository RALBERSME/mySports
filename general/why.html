          Most people dream of a happy life. People who are sick have only one
          wish (problem):<br />
          <em>"I want to get healthy!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we are healthy, we can solve and implement many wishes
          (problems).<br />
          Physical activity is good for our health. So why don't we use this
          opportunity to keep ourselves fit, flexible and healthy? Physical
          activity can also be fun. Of course, you shouldn't overdo it with
          sport. Sport also helps reduce stress.
